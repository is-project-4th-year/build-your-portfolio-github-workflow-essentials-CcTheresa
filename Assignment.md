## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought branches were just for separating work between different users, like "each developer has their own branch they work on and push to."

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Branches are feature-specific, not user-specific! Even as a solo developer, I learned to use branches to isolate features like updating my "Skills" section or fixing bugs.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: This approach helped me keep my main branch stable while experimenting with new changes in feature branches before merging them back in.

**2. Concept: Commit Messages**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I assumed commits were just short notes about what I did, nothing too serious.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Commits actually follow structured conventions (like feat: or fix:), making the code history cleaner and easier to understand. Itâ€™s like commenting your code but for your version control history.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Using meaningful commit messages allowed me to track progress clearly and link commits to GitHub Issues for better project management.

**3. Concept: Undoing Mistakes**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought once you make a change and commit, theres no going back.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Git provides several commands for reverting changes, and safe ways to undo commits while preserving history i.e, git reset, git revert, git ammend etc.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: This gave me more confidence while working on my portoflio and group assignmennt; knowing that any mistake can be undone before pushing to remote repo.

**4. Concept: Collaboration**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I believed GitHub was just a place to store code, and you needed to use other tools for project management and collaboration.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: GitHub offers a full project management workflow: milestones, issues, project boards, and pull requests. It has features for reviewing and assigning reviewees within the project setup

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: This made collaboration feel more practical and professional, even for solo projects. I managed tasks, tracked progress, and simulated real-world workflows locally.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features
